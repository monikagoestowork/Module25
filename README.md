About Dataset
ðŸ§  Lifestyle and Health Classification Dataset
This dataset contains detailed lifestyle and biometric information from 100,000 individuals. The goal is to predict the likelihood of having a disease based on habits, health metrics, demographics, and psychological indicators.

ðŸ“¦Dataset Overview
Rows: 100,000 individuals
Columns: 40 features + 1 target
Target: target â†’ Binary classification:

healthy
diseased
Imbalanced: ~70% healthy, ~30% diseased

Data Types: Numerical, categorical, ordinal
  
ðŸŽ¯ Target Definition
The target column indicates whether an individual is diagnosed with a certain disease or not. The classification is based on medical and lifestyle indicators derived from the individualâ€™s profile.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
This is not a medical diagnosis tool. It's designed for educational, academic, and research purposes.
Columns like bmi_triple and bmi_duplicate are intentionally designed for students to explore feature redundancy and correlation.
The target was not blindly assigned; label logic respects the underlying feature patterns.

Summary of Findings
This feature importance chart is much more meaningful than the previous one. The fact that the importance scores are more evenly distributed and that the model is (presumably) no longer predicting only one class indicates that the class_weight parameter was successful. The model is now actively trying to find the subtle signals that differentiate between 'healthy' and 'diseased' outcomes.

What the Chart Shows

The chart displays the top 15 features that the tuned Random Forest model found most useful for making its predictions. The "Importance Score" on the x-axis represents the relative contribution of each feature to the model's decision-making process.
The top five most influential factors, according to your model, are:
- work_hours
- glucose
- sugar_intake
- cholesterol
- sleep_hours

Conclusions and Predictions

Lifestyle and Metabolic Factors are Key: The most significant conclusion is that a combination of lifestyle choices and key metabolic indicators are the primary drivers of the health outcomes in your dataset. Factors like work_hours, sugar_intake, and sleep_hours are behavioral, while glucose and cholesterol are direct physiological measurements. This suggests a strong link between daily habits and metabolic health.
work_hours is a Powerful, Complex Predictor: It's interesting that work_hours is the most important feature. This is likely a proxy for several other unmeasured factors. For example, high work hours could correlate with higher stress, less time for exercise, poorer diet choices, and disrupted sleep, all of which are known to impact health.
Diet is a Major Contributor: The high importance of glucose, sugar_intake, and cholesterol strongly indicates that diet is a critical component in distinguishing between the 'healthy' and 'diseased' groups in your data. The model has learned that these values are significant predictors.
Predictions can be made based on a holistic view: A key prediction from this analysis is that you cannot determine someone's health status based on a single factor alone. The model needs a combination of many features to make an accurate prediction. For instance, knowing someone's glucose level is useful, but knowing their glucose, work_hours, and sleep_hours together is much more powerful. This highlights the interconnectedness of these lifestyle and health factors.
